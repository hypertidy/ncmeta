Description: Extract metadata from 'NetCDF' data sources, these can be files, file handles or
 servers. This package leverages and extends the lower level functions of the 'RNetCDF' package 
 providing a consistent set of functions that all return data frames. We introduce named concepts 
 of 'grid', 'axis' and 'source' which are all meaningful entities without formal definition in the 
 'NetCDF' library <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>. 'RNetCDF' matches the library 
 itself with only the named concepts of 'variables', 'dimensions' and 'attributes'.
